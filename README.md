### Spread The Word
This will become a solution where you can do the folling:

Register that you are sick with Covid-19 symptoms.
Register important data on how you may have gotten sick.
Update the data once you have recovered.

For people who are not sick this will be the natural place to see:

How many people have registered that they are assuming they have Covid-19.
About those people, visualisations will also show

Age
Gender
Location (city)
Lifestyle such as
    Size of household
    How many people the infected tended to meet per day and week.
How they believe they got sick
How bad their symptoms are
Previous conditions such as asthma, KOL, etc.

This project started the 4th of April around 16pm, which means that there hasn't been enough time to finalize visualisations, the logging in and the updating of information when somebody wants to report that they've recovered. If given the opportunity I will make sure that graphics will improve (no time has been put on graphics so far) as well as usability, etc.
